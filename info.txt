Run the Script:

Save the code to a Python file (e.g., netcheck.py).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script using python netcheck.py.
Welcome Message:

Upon running the script, you'll see a welcome message.
Select a Tool:

The script will display a menu with options to choose from:
Enter 1 for Telnet
Enter 2 for Netcat (TCP)
Enter 3 for Netcat (UDP)
Enter 4 for Traceroute
Choose a Tool:

For this example, let's say you want to test a Telnet connection. Enter 1 and press Enter.
Enter IP Address:

You'll be prompted to enter the target IP address. Input the IP address you want to test (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and press Enter.
Enter Port:

Next, you'll be prompted to enter the target port number. Input the port number (e.g., 80) and press Enter.
Tool Execution:

The script will execute the chosen tool (in this case, Telnet) with the provided IP address and port.
Result:

You'll see the output of the Telnet command.
Repeat or Exit:

After executing the selected tool, you'll be asked if you want to make another NetCheck (Y/n). 
If you want to perform another network check, type Y and press Enter. If you want to exit the script, type n and press Enter.
Repeat or Exit:

Depending on your choice, you can either perform another network check or exit the script.
Remember that this script allows you to choose from Telnet, Netcat (TCP), Netcat (UDP), 
and Traceroute tools, and it provides a simple way to interactively test network connections. 
You can repeat the process for different tools and IP/port combinations as needed.
